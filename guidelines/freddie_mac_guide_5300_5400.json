The Seller must determine when additional analysis and documentation is needed to support the determination of stable and consistent monthly income.\n(b) General requirements for all stable monthly income\nStable monthly income: Stable monthly income is the Borrower's verified gross monthly income from all acceptable and verifiable sources that can reasonably be expected to continue for at least the next three years. For each income source used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine that both the source and the amount of the income are stable, with a consistent level of earnings.\nThe income used to qualify the Borrower (whether or not specifically addressed as an income source or type in Topic 5300) and the documentation in the Mortgage file must be evaluated for stable monthly income qualification requirements and must meet the requirements of Topic 5300.\nIncome that does not meet these requirements or is not calculated correctly may invalidate the Loan Product Advisor® Risk Class on the Feedback Certificate.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-1\nCryptocurrency: Income that is paid to the Borrower in cryptocurrency may not be used for qualification.\nWritten analysis: The Seller must include a written analysis of the income and amount in the Mortgage file. A written analysis includes topics such as:\nThe calculation used to determine the amount of the qualifying income, unless the qualifying income can be clearly derived from documentation in the Mortgage file (e.g., Social Security pre-determined payment amounts, annual salary); and\nThe rationale for determining that the source and the amount of the qualifying income are stable, including any rationale applicable to the stability, history, calculation and continuance of the income\nMortgage file documentation: All documentation used to establish stable monthly income must be retained in the Mortgage file.\n(c) Income stability and history requirements\nThe Seller must consider the length of history of the income and whether the earnings have been consistent. When evaluating stability of income based upon historical receipt, additional layering of risk may be present depending upon the degree of income fluctuation. As a result, the Seller must determine when additional documentation (e.g., an additional year of earnings history) is necessary to support income stability.\nIn most instances, a two-year history of receiving a consistent level of income is required for the income to be considered stable and used for qualifying. While the source of income may vary, the Borrower must have a consistent level of income despite changes in the sources of income.\n(d) Income continuance requirements\nFor all income used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine whether the income is reasonably expected to continue. This determination must focus on the Borrower's past employment/self-employment history, history of receipt of other income and the probability of continued consistent receipt of the income used to qualify the Borrower. At a minimum, the Seller must base the determination on the requirements of Topic 5300 and any other documentation contained in the Mortgage file. Additional documentation may be required, as described in Section 5302.1.\nThe Seller must not consider income for qualifying the Borrower if the Seller has knowledge, information or documentation that contradicts a reasonable expectation of continuance or probability of consistent receipt over at least the next three years.\nIncome continuance categories and tables\nContinuance of income is categorized as follows:\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-2\nIncome and earnings types typically without documentable continuance (likely to continue) (Table A)\n\" Income types with documentable continuance (Table B)\n\" Income types that may or may not have documentable continuance, depending upon the source (e.g., government program, private insurer) and terms of the specific income type (e.g., retirement, long-term disability) (Table C)\n(i) Income and earnings types typically without documentable continuance (likely to continue)\nTable A: Income and earnings types typically without documentable continuance\nEarnings types and income types\nContinuance requirements\nEmployed income\nIncome must be likely to continue for at least the next three years. The Seller is not required to obtain documentation to verify income continuance, absent any knowledge, information or documentation that the income is no longer being received or is likely to cease. When the Seller has knowledge or information that the income may not be reasonably expected to continue, the Seller must conduct additional evaluation and/or obtain documentation in order to determine if the income can be used. Example (Seller knowledge): If a Borrower has been receiving overtime or bonuses, but the Seller has information or documentation evidencing that the income is already discontinued or will be discontinued due to the completion of a project or termination of a bonus program, the \"likely to continue\" requirement would not be met, and the income cannot be used for qualification purposes.\n· Base employment earnings\nMilitary earnings (base, entitlements, Reserve, National Guard) · Bonus, commission, overtime and tip earnings Restricted stock (RS) and restricted stock units (RSU) subject to performance-based vesting provisions\nRecurring RS and RSU awards subject to time- based vesting provisions\nAutomobile allowance\nUnemployment (associated with seasonal employment)\nRental income\nSelf-employment income\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-3 :unselected:\nTable A: Income and earnings types typically without documentable continuance\nOther income\nFoster-care income Housing or parsonage allowance\nMortgage Credit Certificate\nRoyalty payments (two- year history)\n· Tax-exempt income\n(ii) Income types with documentable continuance\nFor income types with documentable continuance, the documentation requirements for each individual income type listed within Topic 5300 provide the minimum documentation required in order for the Seller to verify income continuance for at least three years.\nTable B: Income types with documentable continuance\nIncome types\nContinuance requirement highlights1\nMortgage differential\nDocument duration of payments (Refer to Sections 5303.1 and 5305.1)\nNotes receivable\nRoyalty payments (one-year history)\nNonrecurring RS and RSU awards subject to time-based vesting provisions\nTrust income (fixed payment)\nAlimony, child support and/or separate maintenance\nDocument duration of obligation (Refer to Section 5305.1)\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-4\nTable B: Income types with documentable continuance\nHomeownership Voucher Program (HOV)\nDocument duration of HOV term limit for assistance (Refer to Section 5305.1)\nCapital gains\nDocument sufficient assets (Refer to Section 5305.1)\nDividend and interest\nRetirement account distributions as income\nTrust income (fluctuating payments)\n1 Highlights of the requirements from the individual income types are provided for illustrative purposes only. Refer to the sections shown above for complete requirements.\n(iii) Income types that may or may not have documentable continuance\nTable C: Income types that may or may not have documentable continuance\nCertain income types are associated with multiple income sources, each of which may have specific requirements with respect to continuance, whether defined or undefined. For this reason, this grouping of income types may or may not have documentable continuance.\nExample:\nIf the source of retirement income is Social Security retirement benefits, no additional documentation of continuance is required\nIf the source is a retirement annuity from an insurance company, there will generally be a defined term in which case continuance must be documented\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-5\nTable C: Income types that may or may not have documentable continuance\nIncome types\nContinuance requirement highlights1\nRetirement income\nSellers must be knowledgeable about the source of the specific income type in order to determine whether or not documentable continuance is applicable. This includes, but is not limited to, knowledge of factors with respect to whether the payments are received pursuant to a written agreement, government program, law and/or regulation, as well as the applicable eligibility criteria governing the continued receipt of the income.\n(e.g., social security, defined benefit pension, annuity, other similar benefits)\nSurvivor and dependent benefits\n(e.g., Social Security Survivor Benefits, Survivors' VA benefits, other similar benefits)\nLong-term disability income\n(e.g., Social Security disability benefits, VA disability compensation, worker's compensation, private disability insurance)\nRefer to Section 5305.1 for requirements for these income types. For long-term disability and SSI income types: Pending or current re-evaluation of medical eligibility for insurance and/or benefit payments is not considered an indication that the insurance and/or benefit payment will not continue.\nSocial Security Supplemental Security Income (SSI)\nPublic assistance income (e.g., Temporary Assistance for Needy Families)\n1 Highlights of the requirements from the individual income types are provided for illustrative purposes only. Refer to the sections shown above for complete requirements.\n(e) Alimony payments\nThe amount of the monthly alimony payment must be deducted from the stable monthly income if both of the following apply:\n1. The Borrower is obligated to pay alimony\n2. There are more than 10 months of payments remaining\nNote: See Section 5401.2(b)(3) for additional information.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-6\n5301.2: General requirements for all stable monthly asset qualification sources (03/05/25)\nAsset qualification sources that meet the requirements of Topic 5300, including Chapter 5307, may also be used to qualify the Borrower for the Mortgage. For each asset qualification source, the Seller must determine that both the source of the asset and the amount of the asset source used to qualify the Borrower are reasonable and stable.\nThe asset qualification sources used to qualify the Borrower and the documentation in the Mortgage file must be evaluated for stable monthly asset qualification requirements. Asset qualification sources that do not meet these requirements or are not calculated correctly may invalidate the Loan Product Advisor® Risk Class on the Feedback Certificate.\nWritten analysis: The Seller must include a written analysis of the asset qualification source and amount in the Mortgage file.\nMortgage file documentation: All documentation used to establish stable monthly asset qualification must be retained in the Mortgage file.\n5301.3: Note Date references (10/02/24)\nFor the purposes of Topic 5300, all references to the Note Date refer to the modification date for Seller-Owned Modified Mortgages, the Conversion Date for Seller-Owned Converted Mortgages, the Effective Date of Permanent Financing for Construction Conversion and Renovation Mortgages, or the assumption agreement date, as applicable.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 04/01/25\nChapter 5301\nPage 5301-7\nChapter 5302: General Requirements for Documentation Used to Verify Employment and Income\n5302.1: Introduction to documentation requirements (07/02/25)\nFor all income and each qualification source used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must obtain the required documentation and verifications listed in the respective income sections of Topic 5300.\nAdditional documentation may be necessary to evaluate, justify and explain the qualification of the Borrower. This includes scenarios in which the Seller has knowledge that the documentation originally provided by the Borrower may not be reflective of the Borrower's current level of income, even though the documentation meets the age of documentation requirements.\nExample: A more recent paystub may be necessary if, after the original paystub was provided, the Borrower's industry was impacted by economic conditions or widespread business closures that could affect hours worked and income received.\nAll documentation must be maintained in the Mortgage file.\nThe documentation requirements are the same for Streamlined Accept and Standard Documentation.\nFor information about general requirements for verifying documents and acceptable age of documentation, refer to:\nSection 5102.3 for general requirements for verifying documents\nSection 5102.4 for age of documentation requirements\n5302.2: Employed income documentation and verification requirements (07/02/25)\nThis section contains information related to:\nYear-to-date (YTD) paystubs\nW-2 forms and alternative documentation\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 07/02/25\nChapter 5302\nPage 5302-1\nWritten verification of employment (VOE)\n10-day pre-closing verification (10-day PCV)\n(a) YTD paystub(s)\nThe following table contains requirements and guidance pertaining to YTD paystubs:\nYTD paystubs\nTopic\nRequirements\nYTD paystubs\nThe YTD paystub(s) must enable the Seller to determine and support the stable monthly income used for qualification.

Sellers are encouraged to always confirm with the Borrower that the tax returns provided are the tax returns most recently filed with the IRS.\nThe Seller must determine the stable monthly income which may require additional documentation and analysis. Refer to Section 5304.1(g) for additional guidance about self- employed income and supporting documentation when the tax returns for the most recent calendar year are not yet available.\nAt a minimum, the following date and documentation requirements must be met, based on the Application Received Date and the Note Date for the Mortgage:\n(i) For Mortgages with Note Dates on or after November 1, 2024\nApplication Received Date\nNote Date\nAge of tax return and other documentation requirements\nBefore: April 15, 2025\nOn or after: November 1, 2024 Before: May 31, 2025\nMost recent federal income tax return(s) filed with the IRS The most recent tax return(s) must be no older than 2023\nOn or after:\nBefore:\nIf the Borrower has not filed the 2024 tax return(s) with the IRS:\nApril 15, 2025\nMay 31, 2025\nThe most recent tax returns must be no older than 2023 · The Seller must obtain:\nAll\nOn or after: May 31, 2025 Before: November 1, 2025\no IRS confirmation verifying tax transcript(s) are not yet :unselected: available for the tax return(s) (individual, and business, if applicable) from the 2024 tax year1,2; and o Evidence of completed IRS tax filing extension(s) for the :unselected: 2024 tax year (e.g., if using IRS tax extension forms to evidence tax filing extension, include IRS Form(s) 4868 and/or 7004, as applicable)3;\nAll\nOn or after: November 1, 2025\nThe most recent tax return(s) must be no older than 2024, regardless of other factors such as tax filing extension status or IRS tax filing deadline relief status\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 07/02/25\nChapter 5302 Page 5302-10 :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected: :selected:\n1 If the IRS extends the tax filing due date, the IRS confirmation is required for Mortgages with Application Received Dates on or after the IRS income tax filing due date, or May 31, 2025, whichever occurs first; and Note Dates on or after the last day of the month following the IRS income tax filing due date, or June 30, 2025, whichever occurs first. 2 Alternative documentation is acceptable in lieu of the IRS confirmation that tax transcript(s) are not yet available for the business tax return(s), as follows:\n· Confirmation business tax returns were filed after IRS filing due date for the prior year(s) (e.g., 2023 business tax return in file was signed later in the year (e.g., October)) or documentation from third-party tax return preparer confirming 2024 business return has not yet been filed; and\n· Documented evidence of continued income stability using at least one of the examples listed in Section 5304.1(g) in the row labeled \"Business and/or individual tax return(s) - most recent calendar year not yet available\"\n3 If the IRS extends the tax filing due date, evidence of the completed IRS tax filing extension is required for Mortgages with Application Received Dates on or after the IRS income tax filing due date and Note Dates on or after the last day of the month following the IRS income tax filing due date.\n(ii) For Mortgages with Note Dates before November 1, 2024 and Settlement Dates on or after February 5, 2025\nApply the age of tax return and other documentation requirements as shown in the table in Section 5302.4(b)(i); however, the prior calendar year may replace the calendar year shown in the table.\n(c) IRS tax transcripts\nIf a tax transcript is obtained and contains information sufficient to meet verification requirements in Topic 5300, it may be used in lieu of other required documentation (e.g., IRS Form W-2); however, the information provided on the tax transcript often lacks certain information needed to fully evaluate the stable monthly income.\nExample: Individual rental property data, partnership and S corporation information is not clearly delineated in the tax transcripts. Conversely, the sole proprietorship information for Schedule C that is contained in a tax transcript may be an effective documentation alternative when reviewing the impact of a business loss incurred by self-employment. IRS confirmation verifying transcripts are not yet available for the prior calendar year are always recommended, and in certain instances are required.

All income must be expected to continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as described in this chapter. The Seller must analyze all income documentation while taking into consideration the characteristics of the employed income (e.g., employment source, earnings type, income type and stability of the employment history, including any gaps in employment).\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303\nPage 5303-1\nA Borrower who has had different types of employment in the past may be considered to have stable income if the income amount has remained at a consistent level. When evaluating a Borrower who has frequently changed jobs, the Seller must focus on whether the changes have affected the Borrower's ability to pay their obligations.\n(ii) Primary and secondary employment types\nPrimary employment is the primary source of the Borrower's employed income whether derived from employment such as full-time employment, part-time employment, and/or seasonal employment.\nSecondary employment is any type of employment (e.g., second part-time job or multiple jobs) that is in addition to the Borrower's primary employment.\n(b) Employment history requirements\n(i) Primary employment\nIn most instances, the Borrower should have at least a two-year history of primary employment documented on Form 65, Uniform Residential Loan Application, and verified in accordance with Topic 5300.\nFor Borrowers who are active-duty members of the U.S. Armed Forces, a history of military employment is not required for the employment to be considered stable.\nTenure with the same employer or in a similar industry lends support to the analysis of employment stability.\nWhen a Borrower has less than a two-year history of primary employment, the Seller must provide its justification for determining that the employment is stable, taking into consideration factors such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated ability to repay obligations.\nExamples that may support less than a two-year history (see minimum history requirements below):\nExample 1: For a Borrower returning to the workforce after a period of extended absence, for any reason, documentation is provided to support a stable employment history that directly preceded the extended absence\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-2\nExample 2: For a Borrower new to the workforce, documentation is provided that supports the Borrower's recent attendance at school or in a training program prior to their current employment\nMinimum history requirements for base fluctuating hourly earnings: For additional minimum history requirements (e.g., 12 months) for base fluctuating hourly earnings, refer to the history requirements in Section 5303.1(d), below.\n(ii) Secondary employment\nIn most instances, the Borrower should have at least a two-year history of secondary employment for the employment to be considered stable. When a Borrower has less than a two-year secondary employment history but has at least a 12-month history, the Seller may be able to justify and determine the employment is stable.\nExamples that may support less than a two-year history:\nExample 1: The Borrower previously held a job with base non-fluctuating earnings working 40 hours per week for multiple years; however, due to reasons such as position elimination, work force reduction, or illness, the Borrower is no longer employed at this job and now works at multiple part-time jobs that are similar in hours and pay, when combined, to the previous full-time job. Since the Borrower's full-time employment ended 18 months ago, the length of employment at each part-time job is in the range of 13 to 15 months. In this scenario, the Seller may be able to justify an employment history of less than two years for the secondary and additional jobs provided the earnings are consistent and the Borrower has exhibited the ability to repay obligations.\nExample 2: The Borrower is employed as a school teacher. During the previous summer, the Borrower taught summer school and is now starting summer school teaching for the current year. Although the two-year history is not yet fully developed, given the job type and current employment situation, the Seller may be able to justify including the summer school income, provided an accurate qualifying amount can be established and documented based on the previous and current earnings. Additional documentation to determine the stable monthly income may be appropriate (e.g., how many classes, how much, is it similar to prior year).\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-3\n(c) Non-fluctuating employment earnings (base, military, additional fixed earnings)\nRequirements for history, continuance, calculation and documentation for non-fluctuating employment earnings are outlined in the tables below. Additional documentation may be required to determine the stable monthly income amount. Refer to Section 5303.1(e) for additional documentation and requirements that may apply based on employment characteristics.\n(i) Base non-fluctuating employment earnings\nEarnings type: Base non-fluctuating employment earnings are stable and consistent earnings that may be salaried or hourly.\nBase non-fluctuating earnings may include:\n· Exempt (salaried)\n· Military base (basic) pay\nNon-exempt (hourly) earnings. The pay rate and number of hours are reflected on an ongoing consistent basis for each pay period and must be supported by the year-to-date (YTD) income. If the only reason the earnings fluctuate is because of additional employed income (e.g., overtime), the base earnings are still considered non-fluctuating.\n(A) Minor fluctuations in hours\nMinor variations in base hours on paystubs (e.g., Borrower clocked out a few minutes early) are acceptable and may be treated as base non-fluctuating earnings when the variation is no more than an hour per week. Minor variations do not automatically render the base earnings as fluctuating if the historical earnings support the level of pay.\nExample: The pay frequency is weekly. The current YTD paystub shows 39.78 hours while the prior paystub shows 40 hours. The YTD income reasonably supports 40 hours per week of gross pay and the prior year W-2(s) support a similar amount of pay.\n(B) Exception for non-exempt earnings: primary employment earnings with minimum required hours\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-4\nFor Borrowers with primary employment earnings that fluctuate but have a position with a minimum number of required hours, the earnings may be considered non-fluctuating, and the minimum required hours are acceptable to use for gross pay when following requirements are met:\nThe Seller must obtain written documentation from the employer confirming the minimum required hours (i.e., written verification of employment (VOE), offer letter or equivalent documentation)\nThe documented minimum required hours must be supported by YTD income and prior year, as applicable\nOnly the minimum required hours may be considered non-fluctuating. The requirements for fluctuating employment earnings apply to any additional hours used to qualify the Borrower.\nExample (minimum required hours):\nThe Borrower has been with the current employer as a nurse with a hospital for four months; prior to that, the Borrower was in nursing school. The written VOE verifies the Borrower works three 12-hour shifts each week, which is common for this profession, and the YTD earnings support at least this level of gross pay. Based on this, it is acceptable to consider these the minimum required hours and use 36 hours weekly gross pay for income calculation.\nBase non-fluctuating employment earnings - primary and secondary employment\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nEmployment history\nRefer to the employment history requirements in Section 5303.1(b), above.\nContinuance\nMust be likely to continue for at least the next three years\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303\nPage 5303-5 :selected: :selected:\nBase non-fluctuating employment earnings - primary and secondary employment\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nDocumentation\nPrimary employment earnings: base non-fluctuating earnings\nAll of the following:\n@ YTD paystub(s) documenting all YTD earnings :unselected:\n0 W-2 form(s)1 for the most recent calendar year :unselected:\n0 10-day pre-closing verification (10-day PCV) :unselected:\nOr all of the following:\nO Written VOE documenting all YTD earnings and the earnings for the most recent calendar year :unselected: :unselected: 10-day PCV\nSecondary employment earnings: base non-fluctuating earnings\nAll of the following:\nO YTD paystub(s) documenting all YTD earnings :unselected:\n0 W-2 forms1 for the most recent two calendar years :unselected: :unselected: 10-day PCV\nOr all of the following: :unselected: ❑ Written VOE documenting all YTD earnings and the earnings for the most recent two calendar years :unselected: ❑ 10-day PCV\nCalculation\nFor all income used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine the pay frequency (weekly, bi- weekly, semi-monthly, monthly, quarterly, annually) to accurately analyze and calculate the stable\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-6 :selected:\nBase non-fluctuating employment earnings - primary and secondary employment\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nmonthly income.

Generally, additional employment earnings are received in connection with the primary or secondary employment.\nFor additional fixed employment earnings used to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine that the amount of income used to qualify the Borrower is stable and complies with the requirements below for each income type. All income must be expected to continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as described in this section.\n(A) Automobile allowance\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303\nPage 5303-10\nAutomobile allowance\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nHistory of receipt\nTwo years, consecutive\nContinuance\nMust be likely to continue for at least the next three years\nDocumentation\nAll of the following:\n· YTD paystub(s) documenting all YTD earnings\nW-2 forms1 for the most recent two calendar years\n= 10-day PCV\nOr all of the following:\nWritten VOE documenting all YTD earnings and the earnings for the most recent two calendar years\n10-day PCV\nCalculation\nAdd the full amount of the allowance to the qualifying income.\nNote: The Seller may not subtract the automobile allowance from the monthly automobile financing expense.\n1 Refer to Section 5302.2(b) for W-2 form requirements and documentation that may be used in lieu of a W-2 form (e.g., year-end YTD paystub).\n(B) Mortgage differential\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-11\nMortgage differential\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nHistory of receipt\nA history of receipt is not required for the income to be considered stable.\nContinuance\nMust continue for at least the next three years\nDocumentation\nAgreement from the employer stating the terms including the scheduled amount and duration of the payments.\nThe documentation must show that the payments are pursuant to an established, ongoing and documented employer program.

Note: The payments may not be used to offset the monthly housing payment amount used for qualification.\n(d) Fluctuating employment earnings (Base fluctuating hourly earnings, additional fluctuating earnings)\nRequirements for history, continuance, calculation and documentation for fluctuating employment earnings are outlined in the tables below. Additional documentation may be required to determine the stable monthly income amount. Refer to Section 5303.1(e) for additional documentation and requirements that may apply based on employment characteristics.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-12\n(i) Base fluctuating hourly employment earnings\nEarnings type: Base fluctuating hourly employment earnings are not pre-determined and may fluctuate each pay period.\n. Example 1: The pay frequency is weekly. The current YTD paystub shows 37 hours. The prior pay period YTD paystub shows 31 hours. This is typically an indication that the base hours fluctuate.\n. Example 2: The pay frequency is weekly. The paystub shows 37 hours at a pay rate of $30 per hour and reflects six months of YTD income. If the Borrower's paystub shows 37 hours every week, the YTD earnings are approximately $28,860. However, the YTD base earnings on the paystub are $20,240. This income documentation shows fluctuating hourly earnings and additional documentation is necessary to determine otherwise.\nBase fluctuating hourly employment earnings\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nEmployment history\nRefer to employment history requirements in Section 5303.1(b), above.\nIn addition, when the Borrower's employed income is derived from base fluctuating hourly employment earnings, the Borrower must have at least a 12-month history of employment.

When excluding a time period based on a specific event that is unlikely to recur, at least 12 months of stable monthly income must still be used in the calculation. These 12 months do not need to be consecutive (i.e., the period impacted by the non-recurring event can be excluded).\nExample:\nThe Borrower has a 10-year employment history as a restaurant manager. The June 2025 YTD paystub, 2024 W-2 and 2023 W-2 have been provided.\nWhile the June 2025 YTD paystub and 2023 W-2 earnings support approximately $60,000 in base earnings per year, the 2024 W-2 earnings are low at $30,000.\nDocumentation in the file verifies that the restaurant was closed for renovations from April\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-20\nBase fluctuating hourly employment earnings\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nthrough September of 2024, which supports a justifiable one-time event and the resulting reduced earnings, so it is reasonable to exclude the 2024 earnings from the calculation and average the 2025 YTD and 2023 earnings over 18 months or take the 2024 earnings for 6 months and 2025 YTD earnings of 6 months to get an average across 12 earning months (ignoring the specific event).\nCalculation method and trend analysis for declining trend\nCalculation method and trend analysis: declining trend\nThe Seller must use the YTD income and must not include the previous higher level unless there is documentation of a one-time occurrence (e.g., injury) that prevented the Borrower from working or earning full income for a period of time and evidence that the Borrower is back to the income amount that was previously earned.\nIf the decline between the prior year(s) and/or YTD earnings exceeds 10%, the Seller must conduct further analysis, and additional documentation may be necessary to determine whether the income is currently stable. This analysis must include the reason for the declining trend, and support that the current income has stabilized.\n1 Refer to Section 5302.2(b) for W-2 form requirements and documentation that may be used in lieu of a W-2 form (e.g., year-end YTD paystub).\n(ii) Additional fluctuating employment earnings (e.g., bonus, commission, overtime, tips, unemployment)\nFor the purposes of determining stable monthly income, additional fluctuating employment earnings are considered to be earnings that fluctuate on a regular basis, often based on factors such as hours, job type and performance. Fluctuating earnings may include, but are not limited to, income types such as commissions, overtime, bonus, tips, and unemployment compensation associated with seasonal employment. For additional fluctuating employment earnings to qualify the Borrower, the Seller must determine that the amount of income used to qualify the Borrower is stable and complies with the requirements below for each income type. All income must be expected to continue or have documented continuance for at least three years as described in this section.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303\nPage 5303-21\nIncome history and stability - requirements and guidance\nThe stability of fluctuating income is primarily determined based on historical earnings, so it is imperative that a sufficient income history has been established. For this reason, most income types that fluctuate have a history requirement of two years. In certain instances, a shorter history may still be considered stable if the Seller provides a written analysis and sufficient supporting documentation justifying the determination of stability. When making this determination, the Seller must take into consideration factors such as income and/or employment characteristics and the overall layering of risk factors, including the Borrower's demonstrated ability to repay obligations. The income history must be at least 12 months.\n(A) Bonus, commission, overtime, tips (reported by the employer)\nBonus, commission, overtime, tips (reported by the employer)\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nHistory of receipt\nTwo years, consecutive\nException: A history of less than two years, but not less than one year, may be acceptable.

The bonus amounts are consistent based on the income trend analysis. Because the bonus is paid on an annual basis, the amounts received in the current and prior year must be averaged over a 2-year period. It is inaccurate to average the prior year and YTD number of months on the income documentation (e.g., 15-month average).\nCalculation method and trend analysis\nCalculation method: consistent and increasing trends\nThe Seller must average the most recent years and YTD income over the applicable number of months of required history and documentation.\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-23\nBonus, commission, overtime, tips (reported by the employer)\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nfor consistent and increasing income trends\nTrend analysis: consistent and increasing trends\nRefer to the row labeled \"Calculation method and trend analysis for consistent and increasing income trends\" in the table for base fluctuating hourly earnings type in Section 5303.1(d)(i), above.\nCalculation: Excluding time periods based on a specific event unlikely to recur\nCalculation: Excluding time periods based on a specific event unlikely to recur\nIn certain instances, income may be calculated using a shorter time period; however, the Seller must provide a written justification and/or documentation supporting the months used in the calculation. When excluding a time period based on a specific event that is unlikely to recur, at least 12 months of stable monthly income must still be used in the calculation. These 12 months do not need to be consecutive (i.e., the period impacted by the non-recurring event can be excluded).\nExample:\nThe Borrower has a 10-year employment history as a server earning tips. The June 2025 YTD paystub, 2024 W-2 and 2023 W-2 have been provided.\nWhile the June 2025 YTD paystub and 2024 W-2 earnings support approximately $60,000 in tip income per year, the 2023 W-2 earnings appear low at $30,000.\nDocumentation in the file verifies that the restaurant was closed for renovations from April through September of 2023, which supports the reduced tip income, so it is reasonable to exclude the 2023 earnings from the calculation and average the most recent 18 months of income.\nDocumented income breakdown\nDocumented income breakdown (e.g., bonus, overtime, commissions)\nA documented breakdown between the base non-fluctuating earnings or base fluctuating hourly earnings and the additional fluctuating employment earnings (e.g., bonus, overtime, commission,\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5303 Page 5303-24\nBonus, commission, overtime, tips (reported by the employer)\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\ntips) ensures the most accurate analysis and calculation of stable monthly income. While a documented breakdown is not always required, one may be used to support a higher amount of qualifying income, verify bonus pay frequency, and/or support fluctuating income when the degree of fluctuation exceeds 10%.

Leave ceases being considered temporary when the Borrower does not intend to return to the current employer or does not have a commitment from the current employer to return to employment.\nThe requirements and guidance for income while on temporary leave do not extend to employer-initiated actions such as furloughs and layoffs.\nRefer to Chapter 5305 regarding long-term disability income if the Seller has knowledge the Borrower has applied for, is receiving or will be receiving long-term disability benefits or long-term insurance benefits.\n(b) Determining qualifying income and Borrower capacity to meet obligations while on temporary leave\nDuring a temporary leave, a Borrower's income may be reduced and/or completely interrupted.

following table contains the requirements for retirement account distributions as income:\nRetirement account distributions as income (e.g., 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA))\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nEligibility\nDistributions from retirement accounts recognized by the IRS (e.g., 401(k), IRA) that are not subject to penalty (e.g., early withdrawal penalty) may be considered stable monthly qualifying income.\nAssets used to support the qualifying income amount and continuance must not be in the form of cryptocurrency.\nMinimum history of receipt\nThe history of receipt necessary to justify a stable monthly qualifying income amount may vary due to the multiple variables inherent with distributions from retirement accounts. This may include a range of history from zero to 24 months, depending on the individual circumstances.\nFactors the Seller must consider when determining the history of receipt necessary to justify a stable monthly qualifying income amount include, but are not limited to, the following:\nFrequency and regularity of receipt of the distributions\nLength of time the distributions have been taken and whether they establish a stable pattern of receipt over a given period.\nExample: Consider whether the distributions are fixed amounts occurring with regular frequency or are fluctuating amounts occurring with or without regular frequency. For fixed amounts occurring with regular frequency, a lesser history of receipt may be needed to determine the amount and stability of the qualifying income than would be needed for fluctuating amounts. For fluctuating amounts, it may be necessary to obtain a longer history of receipt to determine the amount and stability of the qualifying income while taking into\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 07/02/25\nChapter 5305 Page 5305-20\nRetirement account distributions as income (e.g., 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA))\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nconsideration whether the overall payments are similar when viewed year over year or with another similar measure, such as quarter over quarter.

Certain rules may provide support for the frequency and regularity of receipt as well as continued receipt, thereby enabling a lesser amount of history to justify a stable monthly qualifying income amount. History of receipt is not required when all of the following apply: Distributions are being taken in accordance with certain IRS rules, such as the Required Minimum Distributions rule (i.e., excise tax penalty applies if distributions are not taken) Evidence of current receipt of the required minimum distribution amount is obtained\nContinuance\nDocument that the Borrower has sufficient eligible retirement assets remaining in the retirement account(s) to support the amount of qualifying income for at least the next three years.\nIf the retirement account(s) from which the Borrower is currently taking distribution is projected to be depleted within three years, the Borrower's additional retirement account(s) may be considered when determining continuance of income used for qualifying if the additional retirement accounts in aggregate support the amount of qualifying income for at least three years after the Note Date. The additional retirement accounts used to verify continuance may not be used as a source of funds for closing or reserves, as a current source of income for the Borrower or for the calculation of assets as a basis for repayment of obligations described in Section 5307.1.\nDocumentation\nAll of the following:\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 07/02/25\nChapter 5305 Page 5305-21\nRetirement account distributions as income (e.g., 401(k), Individual Retirement Account (IRA))\nTopic\nStable monthly income requirements\nMost recent retirement account statement(s), documentation from financial institution holding retirement account that verifies regularly scheduled distribution arrangements, IRS Form 1099(s) and/or other equivalent documentation showing income source, type, distribution frequency, distribution amounts and history of receipt (as applicable).\nNote: If the retirement distributions are not scheduled monthly payments (e.g., annual, semi- annual, quarterly), the most recent distribution verified through a copy of the retirement account statement, IRS Form 1099 and/or other equivalent documentation, as applicable, is sufficient in lieu of current receipt.

As a guideline, the monthly housing expense-to-income ratio should not be greater than 28%.\nAn exception can be made only with an offset documented in the Mortgage file. Examples of offsets that might support the use of higher monthly payment ratios are found in Section 5401.2(d).\nGenerally, more flexibility is appropriate for the monthly housing expense-to-income ratio than for the monthly debt payment-to-income ratio. Less flexibility is appropriate for situations involving additional layers of risk (i.e., ARMs, a marginal credit reputation, minimal reserves or maximum financing).\nFor any Manually Underwritten Mortgage for which either of the ratio guidelines is exceeded, the Seller must prepare and retain in the Mortgage file a written explanation justifying its underwriting decision.\n(B) Additional requirements for GreenCHOICE Mortgages® that are Manually Underwritten Mortgages\nFor GreenCHOICE Mortgages that are Manually Underwritten Mortgages, higher qualifying ratios may be appropriate, considering the impact energy efficiency has on the Borrower's utility charges (i.e., an energy-efficient property results in lower utility charges, allowing the homeowner to apply more income to housing expense).\nIf one or both of the higher qualifying ratios are used for a GreenCHOICE Mortgage, the Seller must provide one of the following to the appraiser, as well as maintain a copy in the Mortgage file, to evidence that the property has a level of energy efficiency greater than that of a \"standard\" (i.e., non-energy-efficient) property:\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide\nAs of 08/06/25\nPage 5401-4\nChapter 5401\nHome Energy Rating Systems (HERS) report completed by a certified Residential Energy Services Network (RESNET®) Home Energy Rater reflecting a HERS Index of 90 or below (http://www.resnet.us/directory/search)\nDepartment of Energy (DOE) Home Energy Score Report completed by an independent Home Energy Score Certified Assessor™ reflecting a DOE Home Energy Score of six or greater (https://betterbuildingssolutioncenter.energy.gov/home-energy-score/home- energy-score-map)\nSee Section 5601.4 for detailed appraisal requirements for properties with energy- efficient improvements.\n(f) Other Guide provisions related to the monthly housing expense-to-income ratio\nRefer to the following Guide sections for details on:\nTopic\nGuide section\nARM qualifying rates\nSection 4401.2\nTemporary subsidy buydown plans\nSection 4204.3(a)\nSpecial underwriting requirements for second home Mortgages\nSection 4201.12(b)\nSpecial underwriting requirements for Investment Property Mortgages\nSection 4201.13(b)\nMortgages including a non-occupying Borrower\nSection 5103.1\n5401.2: Monthly debt payment-to-income (DTI) ratio (08/06/25)\nThis section is effective for Mortgages with Note Dates on or after April 1, 2025.\nThis section contains requirements related to:\nFreddie Mac Single-Family Seller/Servicer Guide As of 08/06/25\nChapter 5401\nPage 5401-5\nGeneral requirements\nLiabilities included in the monthly debt payment-to-income (DTI) ratio\nLiabilities that may be excluded from the monthly DTI ratio\nEvaluating debt ratios\nThe DTI ratio is determined by dividing the total of the Borrower's monthly housing expense described in Section 5401.1(a) plus all monthly payments on the Borrower's liabilities described in Section 5401.2(b) by the Borrower's stable monthly income and/or qualifying asset amount as described in Section 5307.1(b).\n(a) General requirements\nThe Borrower's liabilities must be reflected on the Mortgage application (Form 65, Uniform Residential Loan Application) and considered when qualifying the Borrower.
