## What We Did

### 1. Created Pipeline Folder
Moved the core 4-step processing pipeline to `pipeline/`:
- ✅ `process_loan_docs.py` (Step 1: PDF→text, PNG→base64)
- ✅ `create_underwriting_summary.py` (Step 2: Azure OpenAI processing)
- ✅ `form_1003_analysis_agent.py` (Step 3: Extract 1003 assertions)
- ✅ `document_verification_agent.py` (Step 4: Verify documents)

### 2. Created Pipeline README
Added comprehensive documentation in `pipeline/README.md`:
- How each step works
- Input/output for each script
- Complete pipeline workflow
- Key concepts (1003 anchoring, validation categories)

### 3. Updated Main README
Updated `README.md` to reflect new structure:
- Shows pipeline folder in structure
- Updated usage instructions
- Points to `pipeline/README.md` for details

### 4. Created Empty Folders for Future
- `agents/` - For optional analysis agents (not part of core pipeline)
- `utils/` - For utility scripts

## Benefits

✅ **Clearer separation** - Pipeline is now isolated and documented
✅ **Easier to find** - All core processing in one place
✅ **Better documentation** - pipeline/README.md explains each step
✅ **Scalable** - Easy to add new loans, just run the 4 steps
✅ **Flexible** - Other agents/utils can be organized separately

---

## Next Steps

You mentioned you may not keep all the agents. The current setup allows you to:
- ✅ Keep the core pipeline clean (already done)
- 🔄 Organize agents later when you decide which to keep
- 🔄 Move utility scripts to utils/ folder as needed
- 🔄 Archive or delete experimental scripts

The core pipeline is now solid and documented!
