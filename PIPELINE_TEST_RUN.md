# Pipeline Test Run - Loan 1000182227
**Date:** 2025-10-20  
**Purpose:** Test complete pipeline from source files only

---

## Starting State

### Source Files Only
- ✅ **14 PDFs** in `loan_docs/1000182227/source_pdfs/`
- ✅ **30 PNGs** in `loan_docs/1000182227/images/`

## Pipeline Execution

### ✅ Step 1: Extract Text & Convert to Base64
**Script:** `pipeline/process_loan_docs.py 1000182227`  
**Duration:** ~30 seconds  
**Result:** SUCCESS ✅

**Output:**
- ✅ 30 PNG files → base64 encoded → `loan_docs/1000182227/base64/`

**Expected Duration:** ~90 seconds

**What it does:**
- Loads all JSON files (except Spring EQ)
- Analyzes income documentation
- Applies 2-year averaging rules
- Determines qualifying monthly income
- Saves to `reports/1000182227_income_analysis.md`

---

### ⏳ Step 5: Debt Verification
**Script:** `debt_verification_2turn.py 1000182227` (needs update)

**Expected Duration:** ~90 seconds

**What it does:**
- Loads all JSON files (except Spring EQ)
- Identifies all debt obligations
- Estimates interest rates
- Identifies debts being paid off
- Calculates Current and Proposed DTI
- Saves to `reports/1000182227_debt_analysis.md`

---

### ⏳ Step 6: DTI Reconciliation
**Script:** `dti_reconciliation_agent.py 1000182227` (needs update)  
**Status:** NOT STARTED  
**Expected Duration:** ~90 seconds

**What it does:**
- Loads income and debt analysis reports
- Loads Spring EQ worksheet JSONs
- Compares independent analysis with lender worksheet
- Identifies variances
- Generates comprehensive HTML report
- Saves to `reports/1000182227_dti_reconciliation.html`

## Updates Made to Pipeline Scripts

### ✅ `pipeline/process_loan_docs.py`
- Added `sys` import
- Updated `main()` to accept `loan_id` from command line
- Default: `1000182227` if no argument provided

### ✅ `pipeline/create_structured_json.py`
- Added `sys` import
- Updated `main()` to accept `loan_id` from command line
- Default: `1000182227` if no argument provided

### ✅ `agents/form_1003_analysis_agent_v2.py`
- Already accepts `loan_id` parameter ✅
- Updated earlier in session

### ⏳ Remaining Scripts Need Updates:
1. `income_verification_2turn.py` - Has hardcoded `loan_id="1000182227"`
2. `debt_verification_2turn.py` - Has hardcoded `loan_id="1000182277"`
3. `dti_reconciliation_agent.py` - Has hardcoded `loan_id="1000182277"`
4. `timeline_analysis_agent.py` - Has hardcoded `loan_id="1000182227"`
5. `create_timeline_visualization.py` - Needs checking
6. `agents/form_1003_analysis_agent.py` - Original version, has hardcoded `loan_id`

## Next Actions

1. ⏳ Wait for Step 2 to complete (~5-10 minutes)
2. ✅ Verify JSON files were created successfully
3. ✅ Run Step 3: Form 1003 Analysis
4. ⏳ Update remaining agent scripts to accept command-line arguments
5. ✅ Run Steps 4-6: Income, Debt, DTI analysis
6. ✅ Verify complete pipeline output
